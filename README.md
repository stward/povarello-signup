__Poverello Sign-in App__

This is an app that will run on tablets at the Poverello homeless center for people to sign in with. The current system is a mess of paper, and isn't super efficient, so this will help streamline their process.

The basics:

The public side of the program will be simple question pages: A block with the Poverello logo and simple instructions, then the question in the middle of the page, and then the relevant answer buttons below. A back button is below all that, in case the user messes up.

Since the app is running on a tablet, the buttons should be large and easy to press. The users are also going to be homeless and sometimes disabled, so the UI should remain super simple.

-What is your gender? (M/F)

-Is this your first meal here this year? (Y/N)

-Is this your first meal here this month? (skip if they answered no to the previous question)

-What age category do you fall under? (under 18, 18 to 54, 55+)

-Are you currently employed? (Y/N)

-Are you a veteran? (Y/N)

(a review page is a possibility at the end here. "look at your info, make sure you got everything right")

The app will then need some sort of interface to view all the data collected.
